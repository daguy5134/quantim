<h1>Quantim</h1>
<hr><p>Acts as a personal agenda for students by students.</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>This project is intended to work as a personal agenda and the intended user is students, but anyone can use it, even though features are thought for school life. Also, I am a french student and so is my collaborator (my friend) so the project is in french (we're thinking about making an english version in the future).</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>It solves a frequent problem we had in class :
where is the ultimate location of homeworks ? Is it on PRONOTE (an online platform for education used by french schools) or what is said in class by the teacher. Normally, it should be PRONOTE. But sometimes, teachers say what we have to do in class but don't put in on PRONOTE, and vice versa.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>So, we decided to create a website that would have a centralized view of homeworks.</li>
